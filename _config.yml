        Being a undergraduate student, my major was geographic infomation science in the School of Geomatics and Urban Spatial Informatics at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture.
        My major courses have Spatial Database Principles, GIS design and implementation, GPS data processing, Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing and so on. 
        In the course of my studies, I was intorducted to programming and developed a keen interest in it. Therefore, I chosen a graduation project related programming named The Development of Lightweight WebGis Based on Json, which used geoserver and opeenlayers to display geographic information and applied ECharts to show statistical data.
